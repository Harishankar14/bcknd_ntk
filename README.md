# NITK-BKND

This Flask-based Python web application enables users to upload images (PNG, JPG, JPEG) via a web interface, performs OCR to extract text, and translates the extracted text, leveraging functions from an external `ocr.py` module. It features two routes: a homepage (`/`) rendering `index.html` and an upload page (`/upload`) that handles file uploads, validates file types, saves images to a `static/uploads/` folder, processes them with `ocr_core` and `translate` functions, and displays the results (extracted and translated text, plus the image) on `upload.html`. The app ensures the upload folder exists, provides error messages for invalid or missing files, and runs in debug mode when executed directly, assuming the necessary templates and external functions are available.

The code sample provided is a Flask-based Python web application for uploading images, performing OCR, and translating text, not a Rust web server as initially requested. When analyzing this code, I learned it sets up a simple backend with Flask, handling file uploads (PNG, JPG, JPEG) to a designated folder, validating file types, and processing images using external `ocr_core` and `translate` functions from an `ocr.py` module. It includes two routes: a homepage and an upload page that manages file uploads, processes images, and displays results (extracted and translated text) on a template. The code assumes external dependencies and templates, creates an upload directory if needed, and runs in debug mode. A typo (`translatee`) was noted, and the focus was on summarizing its functionality concisely.
